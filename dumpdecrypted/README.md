This is an alternative to GDB, and it's much better than GDB.

It is now implemented in r31a5!

Trying to compile it again (to remove some things, and fix one offset).

Credits:

- Stefan Esser (for making dumpdecrypted in 2011)
- MP0w (for adding support for 6.1 SDK)
- ius (pointing out one erroneous offset in the file)
- urhacked (for recompiling the edited script)
- DblD (for editing the script a bit)

To-Do:
Possible iOS 7 SDK support!
