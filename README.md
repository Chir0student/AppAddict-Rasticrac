Rasticrac with filehost upload and AppAddict submission!

Created by tjglass and DblD

An edited and improved version of iRastignac's cracking script Rasticrac!

Changelog:

- v3.1a3
	- Renamed the version (I think 3.1 is more appropriate than 4 :P)
	- Fixed the cracking script, now it runs				(Thanks To DblD)
	- Removed Languages							(To be readded in the future)
	
- v3.1a4
	- Core script updated to Rasticrac 3.0.2
	
- v3.1a5
	- iTunes locator works now! (Although, commented out, due to the fact it's not needed yet)
	- Added dumpdecrypted in the script (so much faster than the GDB!)
	- ASLR issues!!! (The script works partially because of ASLR - it cracks apps with no ASLR, just fine!)
	- Need further testing with it!

Known bugs/To-Do:

- MEGA API needs to be implemented, if possible! (To be fixed By DblD)

- Check the aasubmit.php files, they aren't good... (To be fixed By tjglass)

- Issues with ASLR = biggest problem of all! (might be solved with noaslr script from pod2g, need it compiled tho)
