AppAddict-Rasticrac
===================

Rasticrac with MEGA.co.nz upload and AppAddict submission!

Created by tjglass and DblD

An edited and improved version of iRastignac's cracking script Rasticrac!

Changelog:

- v3.1a3
	- Renamed the version (I think 3.1 is more appropriate than 4 :P)
	- Fixed the cracking script, now it runs

Known bugs:

- MEGA API has syntax errors for some reason... needs to be fixed!

- Check the aasubmit.php files, they probably aren't good...

- I'm not sure, how are we gonna combine 3 languages lol

- iTunes Locator doesn't work properly (I think...)

- Some weird debug messages (not really debug messages, but it looks stupid)
